# QRativity Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 28-10-2024

QRativity ("we", "us", or "our") operates the QRativity Chrome Extension ("the Extension").

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Extension.

## Information Collection and Use
QRativity does not collect any personal information from users. We may only access and modify URLs directly for QR code generation within the Extension.

## Permissions Justification
The Extension requests the `activeTab` permission to allow users to quickly generate QR codes from their active browser tab URL. This data is used solely to create a QR code within the Extension and is not stored or shared.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.
